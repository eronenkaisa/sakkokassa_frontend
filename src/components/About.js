          <p className="text-justify">
          This application provides an accounting service for penalties in sports teams or any group that needs a tool to keep track of penalties.
          The application is my ongoing personal project, aiming to showcase my knowledge to recruiters and serve as a programming playground. 
          For me, Sakkokassa is a project where I can apply the theories I learn at university to practical solution that help teams manage their everyday tasks.
